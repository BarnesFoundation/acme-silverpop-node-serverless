# ACME Silverpop Node
This project is a simple rewrite of the existing *ACME Silverpop* project from C# into NodeJS, with enforced typings using TypeScript.

## Installation 

 1. Ensure  `npm` is installed on the workstation 
 2. Download and extract the repository into your local development workspace
 3. Run `npm install`to install application dependencies (just TypeScript for now)
 4. More to come...


## Development
While developing, use the `tsc -w` command in the local terminal

 - This tells the TypeScript compiler to watch files with the .ts extension for changes and compiles them to JavaScript upon a save in the file
